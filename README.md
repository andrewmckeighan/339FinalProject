# 339FinalProject

Our final oriject is going to be an Audience Response System meant to be used by speakers to give multiple choice questions to the audience and allowing them to respond.

This app will feature three sections: 
  an android app for the audience;
  a desktop java application to set up and receive reports for the speaker;
  and a server to communicate between the desktop application and the client app.
