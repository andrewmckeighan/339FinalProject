Two locations where you implement defensive programming:
	-"339FinalProject\Desktop App\src\main\java\fileio\AppData.java"
		This is the AppData class. It only allows commands that are supported by the server specifications.
	-"339FinalProject\Desktop App\src\main\java\data\Project.java"
		This class verifies that the project file is a valid file. This is used when reading in a previously saved QA session.
		It has checks to make sure that the QA file session was saved using the current version of our program and will eliminate the
		risk of incorrectly reading in data.

Two locations where you might have corrected code smells:
	-"339FinalProject\ServerSide\Server.js"
		There were multiple times at the bottom of this file in "io.on('connection', function(...." section that socket.on instances were written
		very badly. Josh went through and cleaned these up by creating separate functions for this functionality. This was needed because
		the code needed to be used multiple times in different places.
	-"339FinalProject\ServerSide\Server.js"
		In the socket.emit section (at the bottom) I was returning way more information than was actually needed. I was sending a lot of redunant information
		to the Desktop application when I only needed to be sending it a confirmation that adding the question/answers was successful.
	
Locations that are responsible for inter-processes/threads communication
	-"339FinalProject\ServerSide\Server.js"
		At the bottom of this file is all of the socket communication. It also uses rooms that allow for multiple things to be running at once.
		This is the main part that is responsible. There will (or can) be multiple instance of the desktop application and multiple android
		devices that can connect to this server. This means the whole program will be working together across multiple threads. The socket.io
		will also be using multiple threads to deal with the rooms we're using.
		
Three locations where you implement three design patterns:
	-"339FinalProject\Desktop App\src\main\java\ui\main"
		This has three classes for an MVC pattern in the Desktop UI.
	-"339FinalProject\ServerSide\Server.js"
		This has a whole client-server pattern. It connects both with a desktop user and multiple android users.
	-"339FinalProject\Desktop App\src\main\java\fileio\AppData.java"
		This uses a shared-data pattern. It will share the question object accross multiple classes.
